Seeing & Floating: Cupola and NBL Interactive
Project Description
This project is an interactive educational web experience inspired by NASA's International Space Station (ISS) modules, the Cupola and the Neutral Buoyancy Lab (NBL). It simulates two key sensory experiences that astronauts have on the ISS: viewing Earth through the Cupola's panoramic windows and practicing floating and weightlessness in the NBL underwater training facility. The project uses public NASA media to provide an immersive outreach experience aimed at STEM education.

Features
Interactive panoramic Cupola window simulation showcasing Earth views and space.

Simulated layer highlights like wildfire monitoring, city light mapping, and atmospheric features.

Video content showcasing astronaut training and Earth observation.

Interactive gravity slider to demonstrate how astronauts float more freely in microgravity.

Toggle views between Cupola sight and NBL weightlessness training.

Quick facts and lesson ideas to enhance educational use.

Responsive and visually engaging with an orange-purple theme.

Technologies Used
HTML5, CSS3 (with custom theming and gradients)

JavaScript for DOM interactivity and event handling

Video integration for multimedia display

Public NASA images and videos (public domain)

Installation
Clone or download the repository.

Open the index.html or main HTML file in a modern web browser.

No additional server or installation steps required.

Usage
Use navigation buttons to switch between Cupola view and NBL simulation.

Interact with the panorama by dragging horizontally to look around.

Adjust the gravity slider to see the astronaut float differently.

Explore layer toggles to visualize different Earth monitoring data.

Play embedded videos for more context on astronaut training and Earth benefits.
